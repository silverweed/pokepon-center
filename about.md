Pok&eacute;pon is an [open source](https://github.com/silverweed/pokepon) Pok&eacute;mon-like
videogame featuring characters from the My Little Pony universe.

The game aims to be a multiplayer client-server based battling platform in a similar fashion as
[Pok√©mon-Showdown](http://pokemonshowdown.com).

Pok&eacute;pon is currently in development (pre-Alpha) stage, and it's being developed by
[silverweed](https://github.com/silverweed).

Battling is [already possible](https://github.com/silverweed/pokepon/blob/master/README.md), though some bugs are to be expected. If you find any bugs, please report them in one of those places (ordered from the most preferable to the least):

1. [GitHub issues](https://github.com/silverweed/pokepon/issues) (requires a GitHub account)
2. [Comment on the bugs page](/bugs) (allows guest posting)
3. [Add a line here](http://derpy.me/pokepon)
