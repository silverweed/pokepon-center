Are you a programmer? Interested in understanding the Pok&eacute;pon code so you can
contribute / reuse the code for something else? Here is the Javadocs for you!

<a style="width: 100%; display: block; font-size: large; text-align: center; font-weight: bold" href="/docs/">Pok&eacute;pon Documentation</a>

Be aware that the code is far from being fully documented, and the comments are
mostly written in a HTML-unfriendly way, so browsing the docs may not be the
best experience you'll ever have, but at least it's something.

If you're *really* interested in contributing / understanding some parts of the code,
feel free to [contact me](mailto:silverweed1991@gmail.com) so we can talk about it.
If I see some people are interested in the documentation, I'll work harder to improve
it, but until there's no demand I'll probably have no time for this.
