Bugs are known to happen to any software under development, and Pok&eacute;pon doesn't make an exception.

If you don't have a GitHub account and don't want to open an issue (which is the preferred way to report bugs), drop a comment here describing the bug.

You can comment either in English or in Italian; please, avoid other languages (unwanted comments will be deleted).
